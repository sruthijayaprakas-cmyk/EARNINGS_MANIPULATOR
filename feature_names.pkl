feature_names.pkl stores the exact order of input features used while training the machine learning model.

Machine learning models such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression are sensitive to the order of input variables.
If user inputs are passed in a different order during deployment, the model may produce incorrect or misleading predictions.

By saving the feature names during training and loading them during deployment, we ensure:
1. Consistent feature ordering between training and prediction
2. Prevention of feature mismatch errors
3. Reliable and accurate predictions
4. Seamless integration of the model into the Streamlit application

This file acts as a bridge between model training and real-time user input, ensuring model integrity during deployment.
